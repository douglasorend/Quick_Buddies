[color=blue][b][size=12pt][u]Introduction[/u][/size][/b][/color]
This mod uses the tip/trick written by [url=http://www.simplemachines.org/community/index.php?action=profile;u=51815]ahrasis[/url] in the [url=http://www.simplemachines.org/community/index.php?topic=426109.msg3129052#msg3129052]Add Buddy Button On Post[/url] thread.

This mod makes it easier to add people whom you want to be buddies with.  There are new links to add people as buddies if you aren't buddies with them yet, or to remove buddies already in the list.  You can now buddy up with people in the Post display area, the Message Index pages, the Board Index pages and the Member List.

This mod also alters the [url=http://custom.simplemachines.org/mods/index.php?mod=3894]Followers[/url] mod to allow easier addition of people as your buddies.
